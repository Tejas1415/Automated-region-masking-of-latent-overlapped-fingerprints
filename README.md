This was my first ever research work. 

Research Gap: Overlapped Finger print seperation for further identification is an active research topic over the past decade. Several research papers have been published in this area increasing the robustness of the seperation process + fastening the process + Automating the pioneer manual work involved in seperating these overlapped fingerprints.

This process in general consists of 5 steps. The first and foremost step in this is to manually seperate the 2 finger print regions where the overlapped region exists in both. The steps are not related to my work, hence i am not discussing in detail about those. 
This manual seperation is very tedious and requires expert pioneers to manually seperate the regions without trying to remove the overlapped region. This takes considerably high time to process in the laboratories.

## Therefore, we developed this model considering the above limitation and created an algorithm that can automatically do the initial seperation excluding the tedious manual work.  

Rest of the details based on the algorithm have been well illustrated in the paper.
